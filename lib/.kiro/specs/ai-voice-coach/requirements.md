# AI Voice Coach Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Voice Coach is an interactive feature that provides personalized encouragement, instructions, and celebrates achievements through voice interactions for children using the ChoreChamp app. This feature will use Google Gemini for natural language processing, AssemblyAI for speech-to-text conversion, and ElevenLabs for text-to-speech synthesis to create an engaging conversational experience.

4. IF no voice character is selected THEN the system SHALL use a default friendly voice

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a child user, I want the AI voice coach to provide context-aware responses based on my current chores and progress, so that the guidance is relevant and helpful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the voice coach generates a response THEN the system SHALL include the child's current chore status in the context sent to Google Gemini
2. WHEN the voice coach responds THEN the system SHALL reference specific chores, points, or rank progress when relevant
3. WHEN a child completes a chore THEN the voice coach SHALL provide celebratory feedback mentioning the specific achievement
4. WHEN a child is struggling with chore completion THEN the voice coach SHALL provide encouraging and helpful suggestions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a parent user, I want to configure voice coach settings for my child, so that I can ensure appropriate content and manage usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a parent accesses voice coach settings THEN the system SHALL display options to enable/disable the feature
2. WHEN a parent modifies voice coach settings THEN the system SHALL apply changes to the child's account immediately
3. WHEN a parent sets usage limits THEN the system SHALL track and enforce daily interaction limits
4. IF usage limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL disable voice coach until the next day

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the voice coach to handle errors gracefully, so that children have a smooth experience even when services are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN a session ends THEN the system SHALL save key conversation points for future reference
4. WHEN a new session begins THEN the system SHALL reference previous achievements or ongoing goals when appropriate

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the voice coach system to be modular and maintainable, so that individual services can be updated or replaced without affecting the entire feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria
