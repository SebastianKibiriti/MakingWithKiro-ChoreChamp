# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Dual Dashboard System is a core feature of Chore Champion that provides separate, role-specific interfaces for parents and children. Parents need a comprehensive management interface to oversee chores, approve completions, manage rewards, and monitor progress across multiple children. Children need an engaging, gamified interface that presents chores as missions, shows their rank progression, and provides motivation through visual feedback and achievements.
