## 🎯 What It's About

Chore Champion addresses the common parental challenge of motivating children to complete household tasks. It turns mundane chores into exciting "missions" within an army-themed gamified system. The core idea is to foster responsibility, time management, and a sense of contribution in children while reducing stress for parents.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 How to Use It

The application features a **dual dashboard system** tailored for both parents and children:

### For Parents:

- Parents sign up and create profiles for their children.
- They can define **custom chores**, assign point values to each, and set up recurring tasks.
- Parents manage a flexible **reward system**, linking rewards to specific "army ranks" or points earned.
- They review and approve chore completion requests submitted by their children, which then awards points.
- The parent dashboard provides an overview of children's progress, pending requests, and overall household activity.

### For Children:

- Children access their own **"Mission Hub"** dashboard.
- They view their assigned missions (chores) and their associated point values.
- As they complete tasks, they can submit them for parent approval.
- The app tracks their points, and as they accumulate them, they advance through different **"army ranks"** (e.g., Recruit Rascal, Task Trooper, Chore Corporal).
- Reaching new ranks unlocks privileges and makes them eligible to claim custom rewards set by their parents.
- A key interactive feature is the **AI Voice Coach**, which provides encouragement, instructions, and celebrates achievements through voice interactions.
