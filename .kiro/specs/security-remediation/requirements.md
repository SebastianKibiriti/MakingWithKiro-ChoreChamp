# Security Remediation Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for securing the Chore Champion project after environment variables containing sensitive API keys were accidentally committed to the git repository. The remediation must address immediate security risks, prevent future exposure, and implement proper secrets management practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Immediate Key Rotation

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want all exposed API keys to be immediately rotated, so that unauthorized access to external services is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the remediation process begins THEN the system SHALL identify all exposed API keys from the git history
2. WHEN API keys are identified THEN the system SHALL revoke or rotate each key through the respective service provider
3. WHEN new keys are generated THEN the system SHALL verify that old keys no longer provide access
4. WHEN key rotation is complete THEN the system SHALL update all deployment environments with new keys

### Requirement 2: Git History Sanitization

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the sensitive data removed from git history, so that the exposed keys cannot be accessed through version control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN git history contains sensitive data THEN the system SHALL use git filter-branch or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove the data
2. WHEN history is rewritten THEN the system SHALL force-push the cleaned history to all remote repositories
3. WHEN history sanitization is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that sensitive data is no longer accessible in any commit
4. IF the repository is public THEN the system SHALL consider the keys permanently compromised regardless of history cleaning

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Environment Security

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved environment variable management, so that sensitive data is properly protected and never accidentally committed again.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up environment variables THEN the system SHALL use a secure secrets management approach
2. WHEN environment files exist THEN the system SHALL ensure they are properly excluded from version control
3. WHEN new environment variables are added THEN the system SHALL validate they follow security best practices
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL use platform-specific secure environment variable storage

### Requirement 4: Access Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want to monitor API key usage and detect unauthorized access, so that security breaches can be identified quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API keys are in use THEN the system SHALL monitor usage patterns for anomalies
2. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL alert the project owner immediately
3. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL log all API key usage with timestamps and source information
4. WHEN alerts are configured THEN the system SHALL provide multiple notification channels

### Requirement 5: Security Best Practices Implementation

**User Story:** As a development team, I want security best practices enforced in the development workflow, so that similar incidents are prevented in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN committing code THEN the system SHALL scan for potential secrets before allowing the commit
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL automatically check for exposed sensitive data
3. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN the system SHALL provide secure alternatives to local files
4. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN the system SHALL include security training and setup procedures

### Requirement 6: Service-Specific Security Measures

**User Story:** As a user of external APIs, I want service-specific security measures implemented, so that each API provider's security recommendations are followed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Supabase THEN the system SHALL implement Row Level Security policies and proper key management
2. WHEN using Google Gemini API THEN the system SHALL implement API key restrictions and usage quotas
3. WHEN using ElevenLabs API THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and usage monitoring
4. WHEN using AssemblyAI THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication and access controls

### Requirement 7: Incident Documentation and Response

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want comprehensive documentation of the security incident and response, so that lessons learned can prevent future occurrences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the incident occurs THEN the system SHALL document the timeline and scope of exposure
2. WHEN remediation steps are taken THEN the system SHALL record all actions and their outcomes
3. WHEN the incident is resolved THEN the system SHALL create a post-mortem report with lessons learned
4. WHEN documentation is complete THEN the system SHALL update security procedures based on findings
