# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements real-time synchronization for chore status updates between parent and child dashboards. When a child completes a chore and it becomes pending approval, the parent dashboard should immediately show the pending chore without requiring a page reload. Similarly, when a parent approves or rejects a chore, the child dashboard should instantly reflect the status change.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a parent, I want to see pending chore approvals appear immediately on my dashboard when children complete chores, so that I can provide timely feedback without constantly refreshing the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a child marks a chore as completed THEN the parent dashboard SHALL immediately display the chore in the pending approvals section
2. WHEN a chore status changes to "pending_approval" THEN the parent dashboard SHALL update the pending count in real-time
3. WHEN multiple children complete chores simultaneously THEN the parent dashboard SHALL show all pending chores without conflicts
4. WHEN the parent dashboard is open in multiple tabs THEN all tabs SHALL receive the same real-time updates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a child, I want to see immediate feedback when my parent approves or rejects my completed chores, so that I know the status of my work right away.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a parent approves a chore THEN the child dashboard SHALL immediately update the chore status to "completed"
2. WHEN a parent rejects a chore THEN the child dashboard SHALL immediately update the chore status to "assigned" 
3. WHEN a chore status changes THEN the child dashboard SHALL update points and rank progress in real-time
4. WHEN approval status changes THEN the child dashboard SHALL show appropriate visual feedback (success/error states)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a parent, I want real-time updates when I approve or reject chores so that my dashboard reflects changes immediately, so that I can efficiently manage multiple children's chores.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a parent approves a chore THEN the chore SHALL immediately disappear from the pending approvals list
2. WHEN a parent rejects a chore THEN the chore SHALL immediately disappear from pending approvals and return to assigned status
3. WHEN approval actions are taken THEN the dashboard SHALL update without requiring a page refresh
4. WHEN network connectivity is restored after interruption THEN pending changes SHALL synchronize automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the real-time synchronization to handle connection failures gracefully, so that users have a reliable experience even with unstable network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the real-time connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
2. WHEN reconnection occurs THEN the system SHALL sync any missed updates
3. WHEN real-time updates fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to periodic polling as backup
4. WHEN connection issues persist THEN the system SHALL display appropriate user feedback about sync status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the real-time system to be performant and scalable, so that it works efficiently for families with multiple children and many chores.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN subscribing to real-time updates THEN the system SHALL only listen to relevant chore changes for the current user
2. WHEN processing real-time updates THEN the system SHALL batch multiple rapid changes to prevent UI flickering
3. WHEN a user navigates away THEN the system SHALL properly clean up subscriptions to prevent memory leaks
4. WHEN multiple family members are active THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent updates without data corruption
