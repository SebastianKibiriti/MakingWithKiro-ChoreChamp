## Timeline

- **Discovery:** January 2025 - API keys found in committed `.env.local` file
- **Initial Response:** Immediate identification of exposed keys
- **Remediation Started:** Security key rotation process initiated

## Immediate Actions Taken

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Identified all exposed API keys
- [x] Created security remediation utilities and scripts
- [x] Documented incident and impact assessment
- [x] Prepared key rotation and validation tools

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Revoke all exposed API keys through service dashboards
- [ ] Generate new API keys for all affected services
- [ ] Update production environment variables
- [ ] Validate new keys functionality
- [ ] Test application with new keys

### ‚è≥ Pending
- [ ] Clean git history to remove exposed keys
- [ ] Implement pre-commit security hooks
- [ ] Set up API usage monitoring
- [ ] Complete security documentation

## Remediation Steps

### Phase 1: Immediate Key Rotation (URGENT)

1. **Supabase Keys**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API
   - Reset both anon and service_role keys
   - Update RLS policies if needed

2. **Google Gemini API**
   - Go to Google Cloud Console ‚Üí APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials
   - Revoke existing key and create new one
   - Set appropriate restrictions (HTTP referrers, IP addresses)

3. **ElevenLabs API**
   - Go to ElevenLabs Dashboard ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí API Keys
   - Revoke existing key and generate new one

4. **AssemblyAI API**
   - Go to AssemblyAI Dashboard ‚Üí API Keys
   - Revoke existing key and create new one

### Phase 2: Environment Updates

1. **Local Environment**
   ```bash
   npm run security:validate-keys
   ```

2. **Netlify Production**
   ```bash
   npm run security:netlify-guide
   ```

3. **Functionality Testing**
   ```bash
   npm run security:test-apis
   ```

## Security Tools Created

### üõ†Ô∏è Remediation Scripts

1. **`scripts/security-key-rotation.ts`**
   - Identifies exposed keys
   - Provides rotation guidance
   - Generates security reports

2. **`scripts/validate-new-keys.ts`**
   - Validates new API keys
   - Tests service connectivity
   - Updates local environment

3. **`scripts/update-netlify-env.ts`**
   - Netlify environment update guide
   - Deployment testing instructions
   - Security checklist

4. **`scripts/test-api-functionality.ts`**
   - Comprehensive API testing
   - Performance monitoring
   - Functionality validation

### üìã NPM Scripts Added

```bash
npm run security:check-exposed    # Check exposed keys
npm run security:validate-keys    # Validate new keys
npm run security:netlify-guide    # Netlify update guide
npm run security:test-apis        # Test API functionality
```

## Impact Assessment

### üî¥ High Risk Areas
- **Database Security:** Full Supabase access could expose user data
- **AI Service Abuse:** Unauthorized usage could exhaust quotas
- **Billing Impact:** Potential unauthorized charges across services

### üü° Medium Risk Areas
- **Application Availability:** Service disruption during key rotation
- **User Experience:** Temporary feature unavailability

### üü¢ Low Risk Areas
- **Code Security:** No application code vulnerabilities
- **Infrastructure:** Core infrastructure remains secure

## Prevention Measures

### üõ°Ô∏è Immediate Preventions
1. Remove `.env.local` from git tracking
2. Update `.gitignore` to exclude all environment files
3. Implement pre-commit hooks for secret detection

### üîí Long-term Security
1. Implement automated secret scanning
2. Set up API usage monitoring and alerting
3. Regular security audits and key rotation
4. Developer security training

## Lessons Learned

### ‚ùå What Went Wrong
- Environment file was accidentally committed to version control
- No pre-commit hooks to prevent secret exposure
- Insufficient developer awareness of security practices

### ‚úÖ What Went Right
- Quick identification of the security issue
- Comprehensive remediation plan created
- Systematic approach to key rotation implemented

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE (0-4 hours):**
   - Execute key rotation for all services
   - Update production environment variables
   - Test application functionality

2. **SHORT TERM (24-48 hours):**
   - Clean git history
   - Implement security hooks
   - Monitor API usage

3. **LONG TERM (1-2 weeks):**
   - Complete security audit
   - Implement automated monitoring
   - Update security procedures
