### How this Point System Works

- **Cumulative Points:** The points are cumulative. Once a child earns **500 total points**, they are promoted from "Recruit Rascal" to **"Task Trooper."**
- **Progressive Difficulty:** The gap between ranks increases, making each new promotion feel like a bigger, more significant accomplishment. This encourages long-term engagement.
- **Family-Specific Adjustment:** This system is a starting point. Parents can adjust these numbers to fit their family's needs. If chores are assigned with higher point values, the thresholds could be increased. If chores have lower values, the thresholds could be decreased to ensure promotions happen at a reasonable pace.
